# kruskals-algorithim-for-minimum-spanning-tree

# the code related to parsing of data into a graph rendering it was not created by me
# I am responsible for the implementation of kruskals algorithim and the various datastructures used for representing the nodes and segments in the graph

# instructions.
# after running the java file, click load, then navigate to the large data set in the data folder.
# entering anything in the search bar will generate a minimum spanning tree of the graph and highlight the road segments in the tree, and highlight all nodes that
# are articulation points in the graph
